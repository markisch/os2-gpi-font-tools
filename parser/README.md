GPI FONT PARSER
===============

This is a clean implementation (based on public documentation) of a parser for 
the OS/2 GPI bitmap font format.  It has no dependencies on any OS/2-specific 
code, and should build with any ANSI C compiler.  It requires several of the 
header files in the `..\include` directory.

I originally wrote this with the hope of eventually converting it into a driver 
for the FreeType library.  However, the procedure for writing FreeType drivers 
is not well documented, and I never had the time to dig into the FreeType 
internals to the necessary degree to figure out how to accomplish the task.  If 
anyone wishes to volunteer for the job, they are more than welcome to do so. :)
